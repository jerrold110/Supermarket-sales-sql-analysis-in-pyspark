# Supermarket sales sql analysis in pyspark
The purpose of this project is to analyse supermarket sales data through asking Key business questions such as 'What product categories are performing well and not well at generating profits?' and 'Which of our branches are not performing well in Total sales and customer satisfaction?', then writing SQL queries to retrieve the data that answers those questions.
