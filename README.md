# Supermarket sales sql analysis in pyspark
The purpose of this project is to analyse supermarket sales data through asking Key business questions such as 'What product categories are performing well and not well at generating profits?' and 'Which of our branches are not performing well in Total sales and customer satisfaction?', then writing SQL queries to retrieve the data that answers those questions.

The queries retrieve data over customer, temporal, financial, product, branch, rating data which involve SQL groupings, nested statements, table joins, as well as change and growth rates.

The program was written in Jupyternotebook using Pyspark's SQL library for ease of display. The date and time columns were converted to appropriate formats from their original string data types in the CSV dataset so as to be utilisable for date related queries.
